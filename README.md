# Troglos-Invasion
Project made during a semester

This project has been abandoned since its conception and currently has some legacy and/or inefective coding.

The project was programmed by me (Carlos Alberto Zgierski da Silveira) and 2 other programmers.

This was since the beggining an ambicious project for less than 6 months to complete, and we had lighting problems since the beggining of the project.
